Kanbanter
=========

A kanban viewer that queries redmine.

Quick Start
----------------

* Download the source.
* Open `app/index.html` in your browser
** Some browsers (chrome) will require you to open the file under `http://`, which means you'll need a server. I recommend [node](http://nodejs.org/), but any will do.
** Others (firefox) don't seem to care at the moment, and you can just open the file locally (i.e. under the `file://` protocol).
* I've pointed the version in this repo at `http://redmine.richard-towers.com`, which is set up to allow [CORS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing). You can either ask me for an account, or use your own installation of redmine and change the `redmineBaseUrl` in `controllers.js`.
* ????
* Profit!!
